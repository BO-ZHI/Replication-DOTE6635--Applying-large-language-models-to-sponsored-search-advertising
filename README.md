**Replication Project: Applying Large Language Models to Sponsored Search Advertising**
This repository contains a replication study of the paper:

**Reisenbichler, M., Reutterer, T., & Schweidel, D. A. (2026)**.  
Applying large language models to sponsored search advertising.  
_Marketing Science, 45(1)_, 123–141.

**Overview**
The project replicates the methodology and findings of the original study, which investigates the application of large language models (LLMs) in the context of sponsored search advertising.

Beyond replication, we extend the analysis by incorporating GPT-OSS (20B) combined with prompt engineering to evaluate advertisement quality. This additional step reinforces the paper’s conclusion that PPLM (Plug and Play Language Models) outperform human advertisers in designing and writing search engine ads.
