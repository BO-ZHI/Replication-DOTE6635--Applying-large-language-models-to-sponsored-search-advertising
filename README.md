This is a replication project of the Marketing Science paper, Reisenbichler, M., Reutterer, T., & Schweidel, D. A. (2026). Applying large language models to sponsored search advertising. Marketing Science, 45(1), 123-141.
The project was finished by Bozhi XU from School of Accountancy, CUHK, and Qiuhong Wei from HKU Business School.

Except from replicating the work done in the paper, we utilized GPT-OSS (20B) model + prompt engineering to do the ad quality review; strengthening the findings that PPLM outperforms human-beings in designing and writing search engine advertisements
